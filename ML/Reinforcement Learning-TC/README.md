This folder contains some of the work I've done at Test & Contain as a Research Assitant. model.jl contains and implementaion of a SEIQR graph-based epidemiological model. original_test.jl contains the algorith presented at:  https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13650. q_learning.jl is and implementation of Watkin's classic Q-learning algorithm to solve the allocation problem regarding qPCR tests for group testing. 

To run the files, please use and IDE and just run q_learning.jl. It will output seveal graphs comparing various policies. The details can be found in the code's comments.
