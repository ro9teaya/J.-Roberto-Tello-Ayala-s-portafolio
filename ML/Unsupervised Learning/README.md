This folder contains two scripts: PMF.py is an implementation of probabilistic matrix fatorization, https://wiki.math.uwaterloo.ca/statwiki/index.php?title=probabilistic_Matrix_Factorization, and clustering.py includes an implementation of K-means and the Expectation-Maximization Algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Models: https://people.csail.mit.edu/rameshvs/content/gmm-em.pdf.

To run PMF.py type in the terminal $python3 PMF.py ratings_samples.csv. It will output several files:  objective.csv contains the PMF objective function for each iteration (fifty in total). For iterations 10, 25 and 50, U-[iteration].csv outpus the matrix for which each row corresponds to each user (the i'th row corresponds to the i'th user). The V-[iteration].csv contains the columns corresponding to each object (the j'th column corresponds to the j'th object).
file. 

To run clustering.py type in the terminal $python3 clustering.py X.csv. It will output several files:  centroids-[iteration].csv: contains the K-means centroids for a particular iteration. The i'th row cointains the i'th centroid. pi-[iteration].csv: contains the cluster probabilities of the EM-GMM model. The i'th row should contain the i'th probability. mu-[iteration].csv: containis the means of each Gaussian of the EM-GMM model, The i'th row should contain the i'th mean. Sigma-[cluster]-[iteration].csv: contains the covariance matrix of each of Gaussian of the EM-GMM model.
