# J. Roberto Tello Ayala's portafolio
A selection of programming assignments I've completed over the years. For the purpose of displaying some of the numerical abilities I have acquired.

The Optimization folder contains code regarding unconstrained optimization (trust region methods) and the projected gradient method for convex optimization problems.

The ML folder contains an implementation of Probabilistic PCA and two clustering methods (K-means and EM algorithm). It also contains the first implementation of the reinforcement learning approach used at Test & Contain.
